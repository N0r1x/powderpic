# powderpic

A tool to print out images in the command line. It doesn't work all that well (yet).

## Installation

Clone it, run crystal deps and crystal build src/powderpic.cr. Run it with ./powderpic

## Usage

Change the filename in the powderpic.cr source file or name your png picture test.png

## Development

  1.Sample a image that is bigger than the terminal so it fits the terminal as good as possible
  2.Command line bindings
  3.Cleaning up the already messy code
